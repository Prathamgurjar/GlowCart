# Logo Setup Guide for GlowCart App

## 📱 Your Logo Has Been Added to the App!

The logo component is now integrated into your OnboardingScreen. Here's what you need to do:

## 🎨 **STEP 1: Create Your Logo**

### **Option A: Use a Logo Maker (Recommended)**
- **Canva**: Create a free logo at canva.com
- **LogoMaker**: Use online logo generators
- **Adobe Express**: Free logo creation tools

### **Option B: Use Text-Based Logo (Quick Solution)**
If you don't have a logo image yet, you can use the existing "Viorra" text as your brand.

## 📁 **STEP 2: Add Logo Files**

### **Required Files:**
Save your logo in these formats in `src/assets/images/`:

```
src/assets/images/
├── logo.png        (100x100px - 1x)
├── logo@2x.png     (200x200px - 2x) 
├── logo@3x.png     (300x300px - 3x)
```

### **Logo Specifications:**
- **Format**: PNG (with transparent background)
- **Colors**: Match your app theme (rose gold/pink)
- **Style**: Clean, beauty/cosmetics related
- **Shape**: Square or circular works best

## 🔧 **STEP 3: File Naming Requirements**

Your logo file MUST be named exactly:
- `logo.png`

Place it in: `c:\ReactNativeApps\glowCart\src\assets\images\logo.png`

## 🎯 **STEP 4: Where Logo Appears**

Currently added to:
- ✅ **OnboardingScreen**: Large logo above "Viorra" text

### **You can also add it to:**
- **LoginScreen**: Small logo at top
- **Header Component**: Mini logo in navigation
- **ProfileScreen**: Logo in settings

## 🚀 **STEP 5: Test Your Logo**

After adding your logo file:

```bash
cd c:\ReactNativeApps\glowCart
npm start
npm run android
```

Navigate to the Onboarding screen to see your logo!
